    <p>
        Homemade fried rice is a quick and flavorful dish made by stir-frying cooked rice with vegetables, eggs, and seasonings.
        It's customizable, budget-friendly, and perfect for using leftover rice.
        The key to great fried rice is high heat, dry (day-old) rice, and simple seasoning that brings everything together.
