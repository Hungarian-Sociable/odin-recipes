    <h1>Steak Recipe</h1>
    <h2>decription</h2>
    <p>
        A perfectly seared, restaurant-style pan-fried steak with a rich garlic-herb butter baste.
        This recipe creates a deeply caramelized crust on the outside while keeping the inside tender and juicy.
        Ideal for ribeye, New York strip, or filet mignon, it's simple, fast, and packed with classic steakhouse flavor.
    </p>
    <h2>ingredents</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1-2 ribeye, New York strip, or filet mignon steaks (about 1-1.5 inches thick)</li>
        <li>1-2 tbsp high-heat oil (canola, avocado, or grapeseed)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3-4 garlic cloves, lightly smashed</li>
        <li>2-3 sprigs fresh thyme or rosemary</li>
        <li>Salt (preferably kosher)</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>step-by-step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the steak to room temperature by removing it from the fridge 20-30 minutes before cooking. Pat it dry well.</li>
        <li>Season both sides generously with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat a heavy skillet (cast-iron works best) over high heat. Add oil and let it heat until just smoking.</li>
        <li>Lay the steak in the pan and sear without moving it for 2-3 minutes until a deep brown crust forms.</li>
        <li>Flip the steak and sear the other side for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add butter, smashed garlic, and thyme or rosemary.</li>
        <li>Tilt the pan and spoon the melted butter over the steak repeatedly for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest the steak on a plate for 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slice against the grain and spoon some of the pan butter on top.</li>

    </ol>
